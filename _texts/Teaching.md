## Graduate Teaching at Virginia Tech

### Fall 2022

*English Department Communications*

As part of my graduate teaching position for Virgina Tech, I assisted the English Department Communications team, conducting interviews, managing the Twitter account, auditing [faculty webpages](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-english/faculty.html) and helping to edit the bi-weekly newsletter.

I conducted interviews for and wrote the following stories during this time:
